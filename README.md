# Black and Yellow Carnage Theme for Visual Studio Code

## Story Behind It

This is my first-ever Visual Studio Code theme that I've published, and it holds a special place for me. 

As someone who is passionate about coding and customization, I just wanted a custom theme for myself. Black and yellow, to me, are more than just colors; they represent a dynamic contrast that sparks creativity and focus. These colors have accompanied me in my coding adventures, and I wanted to translate that into a theme that others could enjoy.

While this theme may not be fully furnished, it symbolizes a starting pointâ€”a canvas upon which I'll continue to experiment, refine. As I learn and grow, so will "Black and Yellow Carnage." Thank you for joining me on this coding odyssey, and stay tuned for future updates!

Please note that it's not a guarantee that I'll finish it, but it's an open exploration of creativity and learning.

Feel free to customize this text further to better reflect your personal journey and aspirations for the theme.
